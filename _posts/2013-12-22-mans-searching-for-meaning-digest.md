最近在重看**Man's Searching for Meaning**, 发现这种书还是应该重复看，并且做一下笔记。

另外最近在知乎看到一句话，印象挺深刻。**要想自由，要么有钱，要么读书。**现阶段有钱做不到，那么只有读书咯。

**Man's Searching for Meaning** 一些摘抄：

> "Listen, Otto, if I dont't get back home to my wife, and if you should see her again, then tell her that I talked of her daily, hourly. You rememver. Secondly, I have loved her more than anyone. Thirdly, the short time I have been married to her outweighs everything, even all we have gone through here."
Otto, where are you now? Are you alive? What has happened to you since our last hour together? Did you fine your wife again? And do you rememver how I made you learn my will by heart - word for word - in spite of your childlike tears?

当时的情况是，作者要被送去另外一个 Camp，九死一生。于是他对好朋友 Otto 说出上面那段话。最后，作者活下来了，写下这本书，但当初一起受难的同伴已不知去向。


> Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way.

> If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be a meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete.

苦难的人生有何意义？一开始不是很理解这段话，但后面作者的一段话好像又稍稍解决了我的疑惑。


> It did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us

如果有宗教信仰那么上面的话很好理解，只要把 life 换成 god，一切都解决了。上帝已经为我安排好了路，我只需按照他的旨意走就好，无论痛苦与否。

> A rich and mighty Persian once walked in his garden with one of his servants. The servant cried that he had just encountered Death, who had threatened him. He begged his master to give him his fastest horse so that he could make haste and flee to Teheran, which he could reach that same evening. The master consented and the servant galloped off on the horse. On returing to his house the master himself met Death, and questioned him, "Why did you terrify and threaten my servant?" "I
> did not threaten him; I only showed surprise in still finding him here when I palnned to meet him tonight in Teheran" said Death.
