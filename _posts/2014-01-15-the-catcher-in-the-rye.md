很久之前就听说过这本书，当时以为——用黄子华的话来说就是*那种*——书，然后看了之后发现不是，这本书的风格感觉就是一愤世嫉俗的哥们在你耳边唠叨他经历过的那些荒唐事。

印象中全书出现最多的词有这些：phony, snotty, snob, dope，还有另外一个词：depressing。当然，也少不了sonanvabitch，hellnava，damn，for god's sake。

Holden 潜入回家，最后要走的时候，问妹妹 old Phoebe 借钱，old Phoebe 把她的零花钱都给了 Holden。Holden 大哭了一场。

old Phoebe 问 Holden 究竟喜欢什么？以后要干什么？
Holden 答道：
> Anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little kids, and nobody's around---nobody big, I mean---except me. And I'm stading on the edge of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff---I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the rye
> and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be. I know it's crazy.

Yeah it's crazy, Holden.

Anyway, 上豆瓣看书评的时候，以为这是个悲伤的故事，所以一直抱着最后 Holden 会疯掉之类的想法。一直到最后，Holden 看着 old Phoebe 坐着旋转木马一直转，Holden 说 
> I felt so damn happy, if you want to know the truth. I don't know why. It was just that she looked so damn nice, the way she kept going around and around, in her blue coat and all. God, I wish you could've been there.

God, Holden, I wish I were there.
